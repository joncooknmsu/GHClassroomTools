# GHClassroomTools

Tools and info for effectively using GitHub Classroom (and other Git repos)

__getrepos.py__ is a script that will fetch all student repos, as specified by a CSV file.

__userstats.py__ is a script that generates user statistics of a repo (used to help evaluate contributions from student team members).

__pullgitrepos.py__ is a generic script that walks directories and pulls any Git repos it finds (and SVN repos if requested), just so that you don't have to manually.
